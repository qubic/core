/**
 * @file RandomLottery.h
 * @brief Random Lottery contract definition: state, data structures, and user / internal
 * procedures.
 *
 * This header declares the RL (Random Lottery) contract which:
 *  - Sells tickets during a SELLING epoch.
 *  - Draws a pseudo-random winner when the epoch ends or at scheduled intra-epoch draws.
 *  - Distributes fees (team, distribution, burn, winner).
 *  - Records winners' history in a ring-like buffer.
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - Percentages must sum to <= 100; the remainder goes to the winner.
 *  - Players array stores one entry per ticket, so a single address can appear multiple times.
 *  - When only one player bought a ticket in the epoch, funds are refunded instead of drawing.
 *  - Day-of-week mapping used here is 0..6 where 0 = WEDNESDAY, 1 = THURSDAY, ..., 6 = TUESDAY.
 *  - Schedule uses a 7-bit mask aligned to the mapping above (bit 0 -> WEDNESDAY, bit 6 -> TUESDAY).
